# C-Man
This project is a recreation of Namco's 1980 arcade game "Pac-Man", consisting of Pac-Man (The player), and four colored ghosts that chase the player

## Rules
1. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts—Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange)—who pursue Pac-Man.

2. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. Levels are indicated by fruit icons at the center of the maze.

3. If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he loses a life; the game ends when all lives are lost.
